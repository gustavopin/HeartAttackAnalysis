# Project
This project will analyze health data to predict what caused the heart attack for those people.
The data was collected at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset)

 - Need to get data from WHO to have a base for "healthy"
 - Rapidly explain what the data is
 
### To be answered:
We need to see the causes of heart attack to plan actions to avoid it from happening.

- Understand the porpotion of people who had heart attack in the data (indicate that if all the people in the data had heart attack we would not have a comparative group)
- More aged people have more HA?
- Males hae more HA than females?
- High cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar 
- Investigate: all the variable have a corelation with the output? (this meaning that: are they all important for a Heart Attack or can some be false correlative)
